#Answer 1
# Student information stored in a dictionary
students = {
    "Ahmet Yilmaz": [85, 90, 78],
    "Mehmet Demir": [92, 88, 76],
    "Ayse Kaya": [85, 90, 95],
    "Yusuf Sert": [55, 85, 72],
    "Eymen Sahin": [62, 80, 75],

#1 Calculating each student's GPA and adding it to the dictionary
for student, grades in students.items():
    gpa = sum(grades) / len(grades)
    students[student].append(round(gpa,2))

#2 Finding and printing the information of the student with the highest GPA
highest_gpa_student = max(students.items(), key=lambda x: x[1][-1])
print("Student with the highest GPA:")
print("Name:", highest_gpa_student[0])
print("Grades:", highest_gpa_student[1][:-1])  # Exclude GPA from grades
print("GPA:", highest_gpa_student[1][-1])

#3 Separating each student's name from their surname and storing them in a separate tuple and adding them to a list
names_surnames = [student.split() for student in students]

#4 Sorting the names in alphabetical order and printing the sorted list
names_surnames.sort()
print("\nNames sorted in alphabetical order:")
for name, surname in names_surnames:
    print(name, surname)

#5 Keeping and printing the students with a GPA below 70 in a set
gpa_below_70_students = {student for student, grades in students.items() if grades[-1] < 70}
print("\nStudents with a GPA below 70:")
for student in gpa_below_70_students:
    print(student)
